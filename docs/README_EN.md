Cute yet dangerous red triangular spaceships will fly down from the top of the screen. They vary in speed, and some even move side to side! Avoid them carefully or shoot them down with your lasers!

### 🔋 Power-ups

Occasionally, shiny energy power-ups will appear. Collect them to enhance your firepower! The stronger your firepower, the easier it is to defeat enemies!

2. 🧲 **Collect All Power-ups**: They will greatly enhance your combat ability
3. 🔍 **Observe Enemy Movement Patterns**: Some enemies have specific movement trajectories; learn to predict their positions
4. 🛡️ **Prioritize Threats**: When there are too many enemies on screen, focus on shooting down those heading straight for you
5. 🧠 **Stay Calm**: In high-difficulty levels, calm thinking is more effective than hasty actions
